# We are going to check some methodology here. An experimental work.

## Goals
- Using meson
- Using ninja
- Comparing them with cmake and make pair
- Implementing test cases for meson
- Then i will port it to github for make it an automation

### Notes
>   You can see that test.c has its own main function. Makefile is going to handle to switch for us.

Lets run:
'''
    make
'''

It fails on windows. I will leave windows here. Lets push code to github and continue in wsl
> it is working on ubuntu effortlessly. Passing test and giving report.
